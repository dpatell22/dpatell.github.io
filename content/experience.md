### Industry
[**Amazon**]() ***(Health-Wearables)*** | *Bellevue, WA*  
**Hardware-Firmware Development Intern**, June 2021 - August 2021

-	Owned schematic design, firmware development, and functional verification for a battery powered wearable.
-	Implemented C/C++ API to bootstrap associated IC drivers, tune IC modes, update status via I2C, and log error and bus communication via UART on a bare-metal MCU.
-	Scripted a MCU driver to automate software validation and published functional verification and board bring up plan.
-	Worked with a mechanical intern to balance cross-functional goals and successfully conducted a user-study.
-	**Leveraged knowledge:** Developed device drivers in C on a bare-metal 32-bit MCU; debugged firmware using Oscilloscope; performed board bring up and validation; performed concurrent HW/SW co-design of wearable.

### Research
[**Smart Wireless Agile Networks (SWAN) Lab**](https://ghasempour.princeton.edu) ***(Eavesdropping on Underwater Communication from Air)*** | *Princeton, NJ*  
**Researcher**, December 2021 - current

-	Research focused on eavesdropping on underwater communications only using a narrowband THz radar.
-	Implemented a FSK modulated communication chain on hardware for real-time underwater acoustic communication.
-	Designed eavesdropping technique to log underwater communications via μ-meter ripples of the air-water interface
-	**Leveraged knowledge:** Designed and implemented a FSK underwater audio communication schema operable on hardware; implemented signal processing blocks to clean, decode, ensure the received underwater and eavesdropped signals are resilient to multi-path ISI and hardware non-linearities; programmed in Python.

[**Smart Wireless Agile Networks (SWAN) Lab**](https://ghasempour.princeton.edu) ***(THz Object Localization and Velocity Estimation)*** | *Princeton, NJ*  
**Researcher**, September 2021 - December 2021

-	Research focused on developing an object tracking and velocity classification technique for a THz leaky-wave antenna.
-	Designed non-coherent radar perception pipeline to fingerprint and classify each object using wideband-doppler shift.
-	Developed a virtual radar simulator in Python to track and log radar’s velocity classification accuracy using to non-trivial trajectories.

[**Integrated Microsystems Lab**](https://www.princeton.edu/~kaushiks/) ***(Dual-Band Phased Array Generation)*** | *Princeton, NJ*  
**Researcher**, June 2020 - February 2021
-	Research focused on developing a dual-band antenna array for efficient transmission at 5/10 and 28/56 GHz.
-	Designed an array spacing heuristic and modified particle swarm optimization algorithm using multiple virtualized arrays to perform tune inter-element spacings to avoid local optima, reduce grating lobes, and minimize side lobes.
-	Sped up array generation convergence time by 15% compared to prior works.
-	**Leveraged knowledge:** Used machine learning, stochastic processes, and optimization on a sparse data to improve convergence time; batched jobs on HPC cluster; programmed in MATLAB and Python.
