---------------------------
I'm a senior studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Princeton University** graduating in the **Spring of 2022**. 

I am interested in the intersection of **robotics**, **wireless sensing**, and **embedded systems**. Specifically, I'm looking to advance wireless sensing and localization technologies to augment the decision-making and perception capabities of existing robotic systems. I hold the belief that the best discoveries come from having intimate knowlege of the various cross-layer interactions of complex systems. I've always been a systems first-engineer; as a result, I tackle problems across the hardware-software stack. This systems approach to problem-solving has motivated my decisions in academic research and industry.

Most recently, I've worked at Amazon as a Hardware-Firmware Engineering Intern. My project spanned both **EE hardware** and **software development** that culminated in a battery-operated wearable prototype. My most recent research experience focuses on **wireless sensing** and **security** by exploring **eavesdropping on underwater communication using an airborne adversary**. In practice, this means developing techniques for a radar equipped airborne adversaries, such as drones, which collects real-time communications from unsuspecting submerged nodes (i.e., AUVs, environmental sensors, and submarines) without cooperation or ever needing to extend into the water.

My **other research** experiences have been in designing **machine learning/optimization** in designing novel mmWave phased array architectures. I'm grateful that my previous research has allowed me to branch out to adjacent fields such as **signal processing**, **radar**, **computer vision**, and **machine-learning**. These experiences have colored my pespective on how to approach other unaddressed hardware-software challenges.

I am fluent in English and Gujarati. My hobbies outside of tinkering include are hiking and photography.
