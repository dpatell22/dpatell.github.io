---------------------------
I'm a senior studying **Electrical and Computer Engineering** at **Princeton University** graduating in the **Spring of 2022**. 

I am interested in the intersection of **robotics**, **wireless sensing**, and **embedded systems**. Specifically, I'm looking to advance wireless sensing and localization technologies to augment the decision-making and perception capabities of existing robotic systems. I'm of the belief that the best discoveries from from having intimate knowlege of the various cross-layer interactions of complex systems. As a result, I've always been a systems first-engineer and tackle problems  across the hardware-software stack. This systems approach to problem-solving has motivated my decisions in academic research and industry.

Most recently, I've worked at Amazon as a Hardware-Firmware Engineering Intern working on the **EE hardware** and **software development** of a battery-operated wearable prototype from **board design**, **firmware-development**, and **board bring-up/validation**. My most recent research experience, is focused on **wireless sensing** and **security** and explored **eavesdropping on underwater communication from outside the water**. In practice, this means developing techniques for a radar equipped airborne adversaries, such as drones, to collect real-time underwater communications from unsuspecting nodes (i.e., AUVs, environmental sensors, and submarines) without cooperation or ever needing to extend into the water! 

Prior to this research project, my **previous research** experiences have also been in the **machine learning/optimization** in designing novel mmWave phased array architectures. I'm grateful that my prior research has allowed me to branch out to adjacent fields such as **signal processing**, **radar**, **computer vision**, and **machine-learning** to draw inspiration from and to overcome previously unadressed hardware-software challenges.

I am fluent in English and Gujarati. My hobbies outside of tinkering include ping pong, hiking, and taking photographs.
