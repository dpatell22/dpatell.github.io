      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a senior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Princeton University graduating in the Spring of 2022.
I am interested in the intersection of robotics, wireless sensing, and embedded systems. Specifically, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to advance wireless sensing and localization technologies to augment the decision-making and perception capabities of existing robotic systems. I&amp;rsquo;m of the belief that the best discoveries from from having intimate knowlege of the various cross-layer interactions of complex systems.</description>
