Implemented C/C++ API to bootstrap associated IC drivers, tune IC modes, update status via I2C, and log error and bus communication via UART on a bare-metal MCU. Scripted a MCU driver to automate software validation and published functional verification and board bring up plan. Worked with a mechanical intern to balance cross-functional goals and successfully conducted a user-study. Leveraged knowledge: Developed device drivers in C on a bare-metal 32-bit MCU; debugged firmware using Oscilloscope; performed board bring up and validation; performed concurrent HW/SW co-design of wearable.   Research Smart Wireless Agile Networks (SWAN) Lab (Eavesdropping on Underwater Communication from Air) | Princeton, NJ\nResearcher, December 2021 - current\n Research focused on eavesdropping on underwater communications only using a narrowband THz radar. Implemented a FSK modulated communication chain on hardware for real-time underwater acoustic communication. Designed eavesdropping technique to log underwater communications via μ-meter ripples of the air-water interface Leveraged knowledge: Designed and implemented a FSK underwater audio communication schema operable on hardware; implemented signal processing blocks to clean, decode, ensure the received underwater and eavesdropped signals are resilient to multi-path ISI and hardware non-linearities; programmed in Python.  Smart Wireless Agile Networks (SWAN) Lab (THz Object Localization and Velocity Estimation) | Princeton, NJ\nResearcher, September 2021 - December 2021\n Research focused on developing an object tracking and velocity classification technique for a THz leaky-wave antenna. Designed non-coherent radar perception pipeline to fingerprint and classify each object using wideband-doppler shift. Developed a virtual radar simulator in Python to track and log radar’s velocity classification accuracy using to non-trivial trajectories.  Integrated Microsystems Lab (Dual-Band Phased Array Generation) | Princeton, NJ\nResearcher, June 2020 - February 2021\n Research focused on developing a dual-band antenna array for efficient transmission at 5/10 and 28/56 GHz. Designed an array spacing heuristic and modified particle swarm optimization algorithm using multiple virtualized arrays to perform tune inter-element spacings to avoid local optima, reduce grating lobes, and minimize side lobes. Sped up array generation convergence time by 15% compared to prior works. Leveraged knowledge: Used machine learning, stochastic processes, and optimization on a sparse data to improve convergence time; batched jobs on HPC cluster; programmed in MATLAB and Python.   Academic Roles Undergraduate Teaching Assistant | Princeton, NJ\nResearcher, August 2020 - June 2021\n Taught ELE203 (Electronic Circuit Design) and ELE206 (Digital Logic Design) in the Fall and Spring, respectively. ELE206: Taught Verilog and RTL design and helped students debug projects. ELE203: Led weekly small group recitations, homework-help sessions, and contributed to the class’s online forum.
